        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Jack, and I like to make stuff. I have been making things as long as I can remember. Through many different projects.
          I have learned how to use CAD to make 3d models and PCB's.
          I learned to program in Python, HTML, Java, JavaScript, C, C++. 
        </p>

        <p>I like to do a lot of sports, although my main sport is Mountain Biking I also do Snowboarding, Skimboarding, Surfing, Cross Country Running, and Backpacking.</p>

        <h2>CAD</h2>
        
        
        <p>
          For the CAD unit we made a Skateboard in onshape.

        <h2>Making the Deck</h2>
        
        <p>
          I started out by making a fully constrained sketch using the center rectangle and circle tools. Then I extruded my sketch, put bolt holes in the board to mount the trucks and filleted the boards edge.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Making the Trucks</h2>

        <p> Making the trucks was very interesting to me because we made parts in the air before connecting them. 
          One thing I learned is that you can use a sketch after you made it by using the use tool, this is very helpful because you don't need to remake constraints that you made before.  </p>
